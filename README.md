Hi, I’m Joe. I'm a UX designer for software and web dev, but my passions lie in game psychology, game design and health accessibility. I’m proficient in HTML/CSS/JS but always learning more.

You can look at my various incomplete repos. The on I've finished in the dungeonmasterAI - its pretty cool I think, and in python, which is why its so poorly coded.

JavaShipped/JavaShipped is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
