Hi, I’m Joe I’m interested in UI/UX, game psychology, game design and pizza. I’m proficient in HTML/CSS/JS but always learning more. I work as a UI/UX desginer and do a little video editing and voice acting here and there.

You can look at my various incomplete repos. The on I've finished in the dungeonmasterAI - its pretty cool I think, and in python, which is why its so poorly coded.

JavaShipped/JavaShipped is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
