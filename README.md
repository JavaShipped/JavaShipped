- 👋 Hi, I’m @JavaShipped
- 👀 I’m interested in UI, game psychology, game design and pizza.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS. I work as a UI/UX desginer and do a little video editing and voice acting here and there. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. Hands are full! But If you've got a game that needs some UI assets I'd be willing to bend a bit!
- 📫 How to reach me drop me a message on twitter @beardyjoes
